# Eric Carpenter - Mid-Semester Written Agreement

# What Is Being Done?

> Use this section to describe the work that you are committing to do so that you and your classmates will have a dependable reference guide to CMSs at the end of the semester. As much as possible, try to describe commitments individually, as separate tasks, rather than as a general responsibility.

# When Is It Being Done?

> Use this section to describe when you will begin each of your commitments, when you will complete each of them by, and (if appropriate), how much time you expect to spend on each of them.

# How Will It Be Evaluated?

> The colleague that you name below will be assessing your work throughout the semester with a total of eight points. Describe the standards that your colleague should use and the considerations they should make when deciding how many of those points you will earn.

# Who Will Evaluate It?

> Name a colleague in the class (not me!) whom you feel is in a good position to evaluate your work. Referencing your class organization and workflows, describe why you feel that colleague is best suited to evaluate your work at the end of the semester.
