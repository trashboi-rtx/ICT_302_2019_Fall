# Eric Carpenter - Mid-Semester Written Agreement

# What Is Being Done?

I will work with my fellow administrators to approve the individual WordPress pages as they are published by ensuring that the content is suitable and appropriate for the *CMS Guidebook*.

# When Is It Being Done?

I will work on this throughout the semester as the pages are published.

# How Will It Be Evaluated?

A fellow administrator, Hunter, will be keeping track of my progress and ensuring that I am approving pages on time and in an appropriate manner - for instance, he will make sure I am not just blindly approving new pages that could contain inappropriate content.

# Who Will Evaluate It?

Hunter Russell, a fellow administrator.

# Revisions for 1 December

I added information on how I will be approving pages and how my work will be evaluated, since I failed to make this clear in my first draft of the written agreement.
