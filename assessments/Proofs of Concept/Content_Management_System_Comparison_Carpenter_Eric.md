## Comparison of Hugo, WordPress and SquareSpace
# Eric Carpenter

# Similarities

Hugo, WordPress and SquareSpace all have pre-made themes available (though they also allow for the creation of custom themes).

All three CMSs are free for basic website creation, though WordPress and SquareSpace have additional features available for a fee.

All three CMSs either provide hosting or allow for you to host your site on your own hardware.

All three CMSs have a substantial support network (either from their host companies or through online forums).

Presentation-wise, all three CMSs can create identical websites (though the amount of work required to do so varies).

# Differences

Hugo and WordPress sites can be created entirely from source code, whereas SquareSpace relies solely on a visual editor for non-tech savvy users.

Hugo file management and site creation is significantly more complex than that of WordPress or SquareSpace.

While Hugo and WordPress are open source, SquareSpace is closed source and backed by a large corporation.

WordPress and SquareSpace are provided as software as a service (SAAS), whilst Hugo must be installed and configured locally.

SquareSpace is better for small businesses feature-wise (plugin availability, ease of use, etc.), whilst WordPress and Hugo work well for bloggers and individual content creators.
