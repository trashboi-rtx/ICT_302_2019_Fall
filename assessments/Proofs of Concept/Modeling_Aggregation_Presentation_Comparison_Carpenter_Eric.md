## Modeling, Aggregation and Presentation Comparison

# Similarities

* [The New York Times Company](https://www.nytco.com/), [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/) and [Sweden's official website](https://sweden.se/p4/) all use WordPress as their content management system
* All three sites seem to utilize content trees to some degree - for instance, content on Sweden's site can be sorted by Business, Culture & Traditions, etc., whilst content on TechCrunch can be sorted by author, media type (audio/video), etc.
* All three sites present content neatly into easily digestable chunks - each makes heavy use of small rectangular spaces on their homepages to showcase a piece of content (such as a news article) in a way that allows the user to determine if he or she is interested in viewing it.

# Differences

* Out of these three sites, TechCrunch is the only one that must regularly sort and present new content, as it is a news site. The New York Times Company and Sweden tend to be more static, as they do not need to be updated quite as often.
* Sweden's website appears to be the only one that models content with tags accessible to the user - for instance, content can be found using tags like Accessibility, Climate, and Economy, among others.
* Some sites use the more technologically-advanced features of WordPress more than others - the New York Times Company, for example, uses animations to showcase its various pages as the user scrolls down the home page (which is better seen in person than explained). Sweden's website, meanwhile, automatically loads content as the user hits the bottom of the page.
