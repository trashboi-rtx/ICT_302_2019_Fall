# Eric Carpenter's Self-Evaluation

# Course Objectives

Throughout the semester, the following “I can” statements have served as guiding objectives for this course. Now that we're at the end of the semester, you should feel comfortable making each statement about yourself and be able to back up that statement with your performance on course activities and assessments. Because of the important role that the CMS Guidebook has played in our course, and because of the unstructured nature of this assignment, please concentrate in particular on your contributions to that project as you evaluate yourself according to course objectives.

## I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.

Understanding the key concepts of web content management is crucial to understanding content management systems. Assignments like the *Modeling, Aggregation and Presentation Comparison* allowed me to solidify my understanding of these concepts - though I certainly struggled to understand some of them at first. For instance, it took quite a bit of research for me to wrap my head around content aggregation; in simplest terms, I have finally come to understand it as putting together related content to make a site look presentable/navigable (like creating a table of contents or a site map). Aggregation for our *CMS Guidebook* was useful in that we have a table of contents to quickly jump to a particular chapter.

Presentation is a concept I found myself particularly interested in. From making small tweaks to the class WordPress site with the other administrators to adding memes to Dr. Greenhalgh's Hugo page, I found that I rather enjoyed working on the presentation side of things (not to mention that presentation is much easier to define and understand than aggregation).

I feel that I have earned a score of 7 out of 8 points for this course objective. For me, this objective and that of finding and using resources for self-directed learning went hand-in-hand, especially for understanding certain concepts.

## I can manage content using established workflows.

Throughout the process of developing the *CMS Guidebook*, my fellow administrators and I established a workflow that allowed us and the other groups to complete our tasks efficiently and by set deadlines. Delegating tasks through ClickUp was critical in establishing these workflows - for instance, assigning the developers to have a method of PDF conversion established on the class WordPress site by 7 October.

The *Mid-Semester Written Agreement* was also helpful - albeit, indirectly - in managing content using an established workflow. Per the terms of my *Mid-Semester Written Agreement*, I had a guideline of what I needed to accomplish (checking and approving new pages of the *CMS Guidebook*) and how I was to accomplish it.

For the above reasons, I give myself a score of 7 points out of 8 for this course objective. Working using established workflows was not a skill I was versed in prior to taking this course, and through working with my classmates on the *CMS Guidebook* I feel I have developed it in a way that I will find useful in the real world.

## I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.

> Take a few minutes on what it means to identify and employ technologies related to content management and why this course objective is important. Summarize your thoughts below:

As an administrator, it was critical for me to understand WordPress' underlying technologies and how to manage them. A moment I am particularly proud of occurred on 15 November 2019; as discussed in my learning journal, I worked with Dr. Greenhalgh and the developers to push a [minor update](https://wordpress.org/news/2019/11/kirk/) to our WordPress site. Though this update did not add many major new features or change the functionality of the site, I learned the importance of installing such patches for security and stability purposes.

I also learned about plugins and how they can be used to enhance our WordPress site. For instance, [this page](https://en.support.wordpress.com/twitter/) explains how plugins can be used to share our posts via Twitter. Also, as my learning journal entry for 11 November 2019 explains, I learned about how plugins can sometimes lead to difficulties, whether they be with WordPress compatibility or approval from site administrators (as far as I can tell, I was not allowed to approve new plugins for our WordPress site, as I was only a *junior* administrator).

I feel my understanding of this course objective merits me a score of 8 points out of 8. I enjoyed learning about the technologies that make WordPress and other content management systems work (and work well) and am confident that this knowledge will help me in the future.

## I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.

Throughout the course, I had to do much of my own research if I found myself stuck on a problem or requiring more information about a particular content management system or concept. For instance, I have had to rely on WordPress' support articles for solving issues such as plugin integration into the *CMS Guidebook* - sharing posts to Twitter comes to mind, for which I used [this page](https://en.support.wordpress.com/twitter/) as a resource.

I also did quite a bit of self-directed learning for the *Modeling, Aggregation and Presentation* assignment, as I struggled to wrap my head around these concepts even after viewing the related lectures. Resources like Deane Barker's *Flying Squirrel* book ([such as this chapter on aggregation](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/chapters/07-content-aggregation/)) proved to be an immense help in completing this assignment.

For the above reasons, I feel I have earned a score of 8 points out of 8 for this course objective. I was already quite versed in the art of self-directed learning prior to this course, but some of the concepts within allowed me to further apply this skill.

## I can describe and compare content management systems.

Recalling the *Content Management System Comparison* assignment, I learned that different CMSs can have different purposes; for instance, to quote my assignment: "SquareSpace is better for small businesses feature-wise (plugin availability, ease of use, etc.), whilst WordPress and Hugo work well for bloggers and individual content creators." I also learned how to compare different content management systems at a high level.

In my work as one of the administrators of the *CMS Guidebook*, I occasionally found myself browsing the site's files via the WordPress interface. This was a significantly easier endeavor than with Hugo, for instance - as I recall, its file management (via GitHub) was much more complex and less user-friendly than WordPress.

For the above reasons, I feel that I am able to describe and compare content management systems and give myself a score of 7 points out of 8 for this course objective. Prior to this course, I had barely given content management systems a second thought (save for WordPress in ICT 301); however, I am now decently versed in WordPress, and understand that even sites like Canvas can be described as "content management systems".

# Final Grade

Adding up each rating provides a final score of 37 points out of 40. I feel that this score is justified by what I have learned in this course (like working using established workflows) and my contributions to the class WordPress site as an administrator (like approving new pages of the *CMS Guidebook*).
